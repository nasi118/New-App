> **Public demo:** Use fictional or de-identified information only. Client profiles and some optional AI settings are stored in the browser. Do not enter real taxpayer data, production credentials, or confidential client information in the public deployment.

This is the **canonical repository and main application**. The separate `AI-Tax-APP` repository is retained as a legacy/reference implementation while selected capabilities are consolidated here; see [Consolidation](docs/CONSOLIDATION.md).

Two complementary components live in this repository:

1. **Tax Planning Workbench** (formerly Tax Advisory Pro) — a dependency-free static web app (React 18, no
   build step) for TY2025/TY2026 individual tax planning. Served from the
   repo root; this is what GitHub Pages and connected static deployments serve.
2. **`ai_tax` (Python)** — an audit-grade deterministic tax calculation
   engine with versioned rulesets, immutable base-case/scenario lifecycle,
   reconciliation, permanent Excel audit packages, and a constrained
   **Tax Planning Analyst Agent** as an orchestration/explanation layer.

## Tax Planning Workbench — Individual Planning (TY2025 / TY2026)

A deterministic federal individual income tax planning engine for tax years
2025 and 2026, built as a dependency-free static web app (React 18, no build
step).

### Features

- **Dashboard** — key figures at a glance: total income, AGI, deductions, total tax, effective rate
- **Scenarios** — side-by-side comparison of planning scenarios (e.g. sole proprietor vs. S-Corp election) with lowest-tax highlighting
- **SE & Retirement** — self-employment tax and retirement plan design (solo 401(k), SEP-IRA, defined benefit)
- **MAGI Phase-Outs** — tracking of MAGI-driven phase-out ranges across credits and deductions
- **QBI Workbench** — Sec. 199A qualified business income deduction modeling, including SSTB and wage/UBIA limits
- **SEHI & IRA** — self-employed health insurance deduction and IRA deduction/contribution interplay
- **Planning Guide / Reference** — built-in reference tables for brackets, thresholds, and limits
- **Audit Trail** — log of assumption and input changes
- **Import / Export** — save and load client data; XLSX export
- **Report** — client-ready report with print/PDF and HTML download
- Floating **Calculator** and **Notes** tools

### Running the app

It's a fully static site — serve the repo root with any static file server:

```sh
npm start                      # uses `serve` on http://localhost:3000
# or
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open the printed URL. There is no build step and no runtime network
dependency (React is vendored in `vendor/`).

### Tests

```sh
npm test
python -m pytest
```

The JavaScript suite covers deterministic golden cases and client-identity/data-flow behavior. The Python suite covers calculation, lifecycle, isolation, reconciliation, import, persistence, and governance controls. CI also runs the cross-engine contract, UI acceptance, standalone-build, and audit-workbook checks described in [CI](docs/CI.md).

### Data and deployment boundaries

- The public URL is a demonstration and evaluation environment, not a production client portal.
- Browser client profiles are persisted in `localStorage`; they are not a substitute for authenticated, tenant-isolated server storage.
- Optional direct-provider AI settings may persist a user-supplied API key in that browser. Do not use production keys in the public deployment.
- The deterministic engine—not an AI model—is the calculation authority. AI features are limited to controlled assistance and explanation.
- Results are planning estimates and require professional review against current law, source documents, and applicable federal and state rules.

### Single-file standalone build

To produce one self-contained HTML file that runs offline straight from
`file://` (handy for sharing with a client or advisor):

```sh
npm run build:standalone       # writes dist/tax-advisory-pro.html
```

### Project layout

```
index.html          App shell — loads styles and scripts in order
css/styles.css      Application styles
vendor/             React 18.3.1 UMD builds + polyfills (no CDN needed)
src/                Application code (plain JS, React.createElement — no JSX build)
  00-format.js        Number/currency formatters
  01-constants.js     TY2025/TY2026 brackets, thresholds, limits
  02-engine.js        Core tax computation engine
  03-scenario.js      Scenario model and computation orchestration
  04-seed.js          Seed/demo client data
  11-styles.js        Runtime-injected styles (print/report)
  12-xlsx.js          Minimal XLSX writer
  05-ui-primitives.js Shared UI components
  13-export.js        Report/export generation
  14-tools.js         Calculator and Notes tools
  06-modules.js       SE/retirement, MAGI, QBI, SEHI/IRA modules
  07-analysis.js      Analysis views
  08-pages.js         Page components
  09-reference.js     Reference/guide pages
  10-app.js           App shell component + mount
tools/              Build script for the standalone single-file version
```

The `src/` files were authored as one script and share the global scope —
`index.html` loads them in their original order, which must be preserved.

> **Note:** This tool is a planning aid. It is not tax advice; verify results
> against current IRS guidance before relying on them.

## `ai_tax` — deterministic engine + Tax Planning Analyst Agent (Python)

The core design rule: **the engine — never the language model — is the
calculation authority.** The agent collects facts, creates scenarios through
preview/approve/apply, invokes the engine via typed tools, reconciles
results, generates permanent Excel audit packages, and escalates anything
uncertain, unsupported, or unreconciled to human review. It cannot invent tax
parameters, mutate the base case, or present a failed result as final — those
guarantees are enforced in code, not just in the prompt.

### Layout

```
ai_tax/
  money.py        Decimal-safe arithmetic, explicit tax rounding
  schemas.py      canonical typed models (provenance on every input)
  rulesets/       immutable per-year parameter files + registry
  engine.py       deterministic calculation: line items, trace, reconciliation
  projection.py   five-year projections with explicit methods
  store.py        case store: lifecycle states, immutable versions, reviews, audit log
  scenarios.py    allowlisted path-based override patches (copy-on-write)
  services.py     calculation orchestration + scenario comparison
  excel_audit.py  permanent, verified, immutable .xlsx audit packages
  agent/          typed tools, runtime policy, Anthropic-backed runtime
scripts/build_rulesets.py   deterministic ruleset generator
examples/build_example_case.py   full workflow demo (no LLM needed)
tests/*.py        pytest suite: golden cases, lifecycle, isolation, guardrails,
                  cross-engine contract, persistence, imports, governance

See `docs/RUNBOOK.md` for the agent runtime and operations, and
`docs/UNSUPPORTED.md` for the engine's explicit scope boundaries.

## Canonical-foundation layer (both components)

- **Capability boundary** — `capabilities/registry.json` is the
  machine-readable matrix of what each engine calculates, approximates,
  blocks, or does not detect; `docs/CAPABILITIES.md` is generated from it
  (`python scripts/build_capability_matrix.py`). Results and reports must
  identify their engine and ruleset; UIs must not imply unsupported scope.
- **Cross-engine contract** — `contract/` runs identical canonical cases
  through both engines and reconciles them within explicit tolerances
  (`tests/test_cross_engine_contract.py`).
- **CI** — `.github/workflows/ci.yml` gates every PR: pytest + contract, JS
  golden tests, Playwright UI acceptance, standalone build, Excel
  audit-package smoke with reconciliation, artifact hygiene, dependency
  review, secret scanning. See `docs/CI.md` (includes the branch-protection
  recommendation).
- **Ruleset governance** — `ai_tax/rulesets/GOVERNANCE.json` records legal
  status, citations, retrieval dates, reviewer, checksums, and engine
  compatibility per release; `ai_tax/rulesets/governance.py` validates
  deterministically (tamper detection, duplicate scopes, undisclosed
  projections). Corrections are new `-vN` releases, never edits.
- **Persistence** — `ai_tax/persistence.py` is the narrow backend interface
  (documents with optimistic concurrency, write-once records, append-only
  streams, retention hooks); `docs/PERSISTENCE.md` maps every canonical
  record and the database migration boundary.
- **Document imports** — `ai_tax/imports.py`: upload → validate → classify →
  extract → review-queue → human decision → provenance-linked facts;
  extractions are never authoritative and approved facts are superseded,
  never overwritten.
- **Consolidation** — `docs/CONSOLIDATION.md` classifies the legacy
  `AI-Tax-APP` capabilities (migrate / redesign / defer / reject) and defines
  archival acceptance criteria; the prioritized work plan is
  `docs/ISSUE_BACKLOG.md`.
